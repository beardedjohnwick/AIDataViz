# MapData Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring changes made to improve the structure, modularity, and maintainability of the MapData codebase.

## Frontend Refactoring

### Directory Structure Changes

- Created a `hooks/` directory to house custom React hooks
- Maintained existing `components/` and `data/` directories but improved their organization

### New Files Created

1. **Custom Hooks:**
   - `useGeoData.js` - Manages data fetching and processing
   - `useMapInteractions.js` - Manages map interactions and selections
   - `useLayerControls.js` - Manages layer visibility controls

2. **Components:**
   - `MapEventHandlers.js` - Contains components for handling map events
   - `MapStatus.js` - Displays map status information

### Refactored Files

1. **Data Services:**
   - `apiService.js` - Improved API service with better separation of concerns
   - `geoUtils.js` - Better organized utility functions with proper documentation

2. **Components:**
   - `MapComponent.js` - Significantly refactored to use custom hooks and reduce complexity

## Backend Refactoring

### Directory Structure Changes

- Created a `services/` directory for database and business logic
- Created a `utils/` directory for utility functions

### New Files Created

1. **Services:**
   - `database_service.py` - Encapsulates database operations
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

2. **Utilities:**
   - `geo_utils.py` - Geographic data processing utilities
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

### Refactored Files

1. **Routes:**
   - `geographic.py` - Simplified to use the new service layer

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Data fetching logic separated from UI rendering
   - Database operations separated from route handlers
   - Utility functions organized into appropriate modules

2. **Reduced Component Size:**
   - MapComponent.js significantly reduced in size and complexity
   - Logic extracted into custom hooks and smaller components

3. **Improved Code Organization:**
   - Better file structure with logical grouping
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Proper documentation with JSDoc and docstrings

4. **Reduced Duplication:**
   - Common functionality extracted into reusable functions
   - Shared logic moved to appropriate utility files

5. **Enhanced Maintainability:**
   - Smaller, focused files with single responsibilities
   - Clear data flow between components
   - Better error handling and logging

## Future Improvements

While this refactoring has significantly improved the codebase structure, there are still opportunities for further enhancement:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing
   - Add unit tests for hooks and components
   - Consider implementing a state management solution for complex state

2. **Backend:**
   - Further refine error handling
   - Add comprehensive input validation
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

3. **General:**
   - Implement automated testing
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Improve documentation
