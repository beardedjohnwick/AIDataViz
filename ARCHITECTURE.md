# MapData Architecture Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural principles and patterns to be followed in the MapData project. These guidelines ensure that the application remains scalable, maintainable, and performant as it grows.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - React components for UI rendering
   - Leaflet for map visualization

2. **State Management**
   - Local component state for UI-specific state
   - Context API for shared state between related components
   - Consider Redux only if state complexity warrants it

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - API client services for backend communication
   - Data transformation utilities

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer (Routes)**
   - FastAPI route handlers
   - Request validation
   - Response formatting

2. **Service Layer**
   - Business logic implementation
   - Orchestration of multiple data sources/operations

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Database models and queries
   - External API integrations

4. **Domain Layer**
   - Core business entities and logic
   - Validation rules

## Component Design Principles

### Frontend Components

1. **Atomic Design Methodology**
   - Atoms: Basic UI elements (buttons, inputs)
   - Molecules: Groups of atoms (search forms, map controls)
   - Organisms: Groups of molecules (map with controls, data panels)
   - Templates: Page layouts
   - Pages: Specific instances of templates

2. **Component Responsibilities**
   - **Container Components**: Handle data fetching and state management
   - **Presentational Components**: Handle rendering and user interactions
   - **Higher-Order Components/Hooks**: Handle cross-cutting concerns

### Backend Components

1. **Route Organization**
   - Group routes by domain/feature
   - Keep route handlers thin, delegating to services

2. **Service Design**
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Services should be stateless when possible
   - Dependency injection for external dependencies

3. **Data Models**
   - Clear separation between database models and API schemas
   - Use Pydantic for request/response validation

## Data Flow Patterns

### Frontend Data Flow

1. **Unidirectional Data Flow**
   - State flows down through props
   - Events flow up through callbacks
   - Avoid prop drilling by using context when appropriate

2. **Data Fetching Strategies**
   - Fetch on component mount for initial data
   - Fetch on user interaction for on-demand data
   - Consider implementing data prefetching for critical paths

### Backend Data Flow

1. **Request Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   HTTP Request → Route Handler → Input Validation → 
   Service Layer → Data Access Layer → Database → 
   Response Transformation → HTTP Response
   ```

2. **Error Handling Flow**
   ```
   Exception → Exception Handler → Error Response
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Performance

1. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Virtualize large lists
   - Memoize expensive computations and components
   - Lazy load components and routes

2. **Map Performance**
   - Limit visible features based on zoom level
   - Use clustering for dense point data
   - Consider using vector tiles for complex geometries

### Backend Performance

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Use appropriate indexes, especially spatial indexes
   - Optimize queries to return only necessary data
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data

2. **API Optimization**
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Use compression for response payloads
   - Consider implementing ETags for cacheable responses

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Principle of least privilege

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - Parameterized queries to prevent injection
   - HTTPS for all communications

## Testing Strategy

1. **Frontend Testing**
   - Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
   - Component tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

2. **Backend Testing**
   - Unit tests for services and utilities
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Database tests for complex queries

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Environment Strategy**
   - Development: Local development environment
   - Staging: Production-like environment for testing
   - Production: Live environment

2. **Containerization**
   - Docker containers for consistent environments
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Kubernetes for production orchestration

## Monitoring and Observability

1. **Logging**
   - Structured logging for machine readability
   - Different log levels based on severity
   - Correlation IDs for request tracing

2. **Metrics**
   - Application performance metrics
   - Business metrics
   - Infrastructure metrics

## Evolution and Refactoring

1. **When to Refactor**
   - When adding new features that touch existing code
   - When fixing bugs in complex areas
   - When technical debt is slowing down development

2. **Refactoring Approaches**
   - Incremental refactoring over big rewrites
   - Test-driven refactoring
   - Feature flags for larger changes
